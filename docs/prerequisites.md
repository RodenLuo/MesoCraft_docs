## Prerequisites

This software is built on top of [Qt 5.14.1 library](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.14/5.14.1/). All the libraries required for running are included. However, on a few systems the full installation of Qt 5.14.1 was necessary (this issue is being solved).
When working with large models (>100000 instances) the demand on resources can be significant. We advise to use both high-end NVidia’s GPU and Intel’s CPU with enough memory (>16 GB). However, testing some basic rules can be performed on a regular notebook.
